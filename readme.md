# Shopping List

Vanilla JavaScript shopping list app from my Modern JS From The Beginning course.

This project was created to focus on working with the DOM, events, state, local storage and other fundamentals of JavaScript.

## Feature

|✅|Filter Items|
|✅|Clear all Items|

||Prevent updating duplicate items|

### Bugs
❌ When delete something it gets deleted from DOM properly, but in the localStorage it does deletes the other element.
